# Section 4

Create your curriculum
	It's better to read nothing than to read the book not supposed to be read
	It's better to read right things slowly than to read the wrong things quickly!

Warren Buffet on reading 
	If you are good at some skill, you can become incredibly wealthy at a very young age!
	Today's society is about specialised skills talents, you need to be keeping up with it! Become world class in it!
	Human Ability is the most scarce resource on earth today!
	The person who is the critical resource, who's a specialist, one who is very good, is someone who is sought after.
	A person with 1000 skills is not the one who's looked for.
	
	Decide do you want to be world class in?
	- Better to go deep, than to go in breadth!
	- At least 50% of what you are reading!
	
	What's your life Major? 
	That is something that you should have an answer to!

If 50% deep you should go while reading your book then what's the other 50%
	- Having a breadth
	- 50% of your reading should be moving you towards becoming world class in something (Depth)
	- 50% of your reading should be getting an understanding of all other topics (Breadth)
	- When you go in breadth, you develop creativity.

Section 6
	Five Step Reading Framework
		Summary
		Preview
		Decide
		Read
		Review
	
	What you need to know first
		The way your brain is designed to learn
			Our brain thinks in Pictures..
			And we Understand through connections..
			All new learning requires a foundation of prior knowledge
			Key to reading is going through the books in a way that takes advantage of how your brain works
			
		Understand Learning as making a Human
			It always makes sense to 
				First Make the skeleton 
				Then put on the muscles
				And build the nerves
			The Goal of Reading is to understand the important topics
			This is just like making the skeleton
			All the point of all the stories in that particular book would be to simply support the skeleton, to help you learn the main points better
			The Solution is to "Layer Your Reading"
			Only go to the details if it helps you understand the main idea better
			
	Steps 1 and 2 - Summary and Preview
		Its easier to learn something when you have already learnt it
		Step 1: Read the summary of the book
			What separates the best musicians from the mediocre ones?
			The best already know how the song sounds like at its perfection
			THE BEST READERS ALREADY KNOW THE MAIN POINTS OF BOOKS BEFORE THEY READ IT!
			Google for the summary of the book you want to read.
		
		Step 2: We are going from the beginning to the end of the book in short.
			Then after looking at the topics you should be able to answer,
			Should this book go into the microwave or the oven?

	Step 3: Decide the category of the book
		Microwave - Cooks in seconds
		Oven - Takes time
		
		If you can read a book jumping from section to section quickly then use Microwave Option
		else 
		You can't do read quickly, put it in the oven.
		
		Ex. How to books or Almost every personal development book and most of non fiction best sellers are MICROWAVE
		 or Biographies or success books etc which are not easy to navigate books or the books that you want to sip slowly, come under OVEN
			
	Step 4: How to READ!
		Read it section by section to extract the idea.
		From Microwave book you will extract the information you need from that particular section and move to the next
		
		Reading MICROWAVE Books
			Preview each section individually. Flipping through it.. Quick preview of each section then only then go to the sections you are interested in and deep dive into it
		Reading OVEN books
			use your pen to Read in Chunks or speed read 
			other option is to hear it's audiobooks!
	Step 5:
		Review the book!
		You might have forgotten everything by the time you finish, so its a good idea to revisit your learning
		It will be faster to do and you'll strengthen the understanding and learning from your book
		
Section 7: Ingraining What you Learn
	"Mastery Involves Discovering the most Resonant information and integrating it so deeply it disappears and allows us to fly free.
	"Any person who reads too much and uses his brain too little falls into the lazy habits of thinking
	
	How to take notes on Any Book?
	
	Step a. 
		- Underline the paragraphs
		- Draw a vertical line along the paragraph that looks important to you
		- If it is something really important, draw a star or asterisk
		- If is is a page, fold the page so that you can come back
		Recite and elaborate
		Recite the words in your own words, read it out loud.
		
	Step b. 
		You can also write it in the margin in your own words in as few words as possible.
	
	Step c.

	Step d.
		Once you read an entire book, Write in your own words on the title page.
	
	Step e. 
		Write your one take away in the front of the book.

Some other thoughts
	Always read well tried authors.
	Revsiting the ones that matters.
	Quality is more important than quantity
	Its better to know little and act on it than to know a lot and not act on it!
	If you are excited to the bone, you'll be involved in the work that you are doing!
	
Conclusion:
	One who consciously works on improving his skills every day would be much better than a person already in the field for a significant time
	Its not always the case that a teacher who has been teaching for 25 years  is surely better than a teach who is here since 5 years!
